    <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
    <p>The pacing for this course and the way it fleshed out the material we were introduced to during the first 8 weeks from COMP001A made this blend in very nicely and make me feel much more confident in my CSS capabilities.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>I wish there were a bit more time because I would really like to explore the different tools available in greater depths, bootstrap for example is so robust in what it is capable of and thats only one such tool amongst many others.</p>

    <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
    <p>This course definitely met my expectations and did an excellent job of building up my confidence in the use of CSS.</p>

<section>
    <h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts had you already encountered?</h2>
    <p>The tools aside from bootstrap were mostly new to me and really helped me understand how many of the different website I visit use various CSS frameworks and libraries to enhance their design and functionality.</p>
